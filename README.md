*Provisional Site*

tridoc offers easy document management for individuals and small teams.

## server-side

The core of tridoc is tridoc-backend ([repository](https://github.com/tridoc/tridoc-backend)).

## client-side

tridoc isn't bound to a single client-application, you can use any compatible app.

Currently, we only provide a simple webapp without very fancy UX, [tridoc-toolbox](https://tridoc.me/tridoc-toolbox) ([repository](https://github.com/tridoc/tridoc-toolbox)).
